Hello! I am a junior majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics at Michigan State University, with an emphasis on software development and academic research. I am an incoming Software Engineer Intern at Meta at Menlo Park HQ. Currently, I am contributing as a Research Software Development Intern in the EnSURE program and as a Research Assistant at the DeepTech Research Lab, where I am involved in cutting-edge interdisciplinary projects. I have been recognized for my technological contributions and creative approaches at prestigious hackathons, including NASA's International Space Apps Challenge, HackHarvard, HackMIT, and more. In addition, I have played a pivotal role in organizing SpartaHack, Michigan's largest hackathon. I am passionate about tackling complex research problems and global challenges through innovative software solutions. For opportunities and potential collaboration, please reach out to me at aarham.wasit@gmail.com.
